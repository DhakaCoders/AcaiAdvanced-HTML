I used Acai Advanced as my extra boost of fat burning power to get those final pounds off in time for the big day.  The dress fit me perfectly, in fact I may have lost a little bit too much weight.  I think that Acai Advanced goes well with any other diet and exercise plan you’re on.  It helped me feel fuller longer and it gave me tons of energy.  I think this is a great supplement for anyone looking to shed a few pounds naturally.”</blockquote>

I was doing a good job on my low carb diet, but I could feel myself starting to get carb cravings FROM HELL. A friend of mine told me about Acai Advanced – saying that she had used it and she loved it.  I didn’t really have high hopes, to be honest, but after the first day, I was hooked.  The energy boost is amazing and I love that I don’t feel hungry all the time.  It feels like I actually have control over my cravings – for the first time ever.  So I’m really happy to say I lost 7 pounds in the first 9 days, and to date I’m down a full 16 pounds.  I didn’t go any harder in the gym or any more strict with my diet, so I’m really amazed by these results.”</blockquote>

Acai Advanced is the first supplement that I’ve used that feels really natural.  I don’t have the shakes and jitters. I also don’t spend the whole day stuck on the toilet (though on day one, I did have a pretty big bowel movement – and I felt so light afterwards, I knew it had to be working.). My week one weight loss was at 4lbs, and week two, I had lost another 3lbs and an inch or two around me waist. I feel really great.  I know when I get on the scale in the morning I have something to look forward to – more weight loss.  I honestly think Acai Advanced is the best weight loss supplement I’ve ever tried.”</blockquote>
